
ATM Withdrawal Simulation in C

 /**Project Description**/

This project is a simple ATM Withdrawal Simulation written in C programming language.
It demonstrates how an ATM processes a withdrawal request by checking the withdrawal amount and available balance using conditional statements.

This project is suitable for beginners, college assignments, and basic logic building.

/**Objectives**/

Simulate a basic ATM withdrawal process

Practice if and nested if conditions

Understand user input and balance validation

Apply basic arithmetic operations

 /**How the Program Works**/

An initial account balance is defined.

The user is asked to enter a withdrawal amount.

/**The program checks**/

Whether the entered amount is positive

Whether the amount is less than or equal to the available balance

If both conditions are satisfied:

The withdrawal amount is deducted from the balance.

The updated balance is displayed.

Otherwise, an appropriate error message is shown.
